"""Dashboard service layer: assemble the per-household star-diagram view.

Tenant-scoped throughout. Runs the rule engine, phrases each rule's Fact, and
shapes the result into:
  * hub      — the status-quo snapshot (centre of the star)
  * nodes    — the household's devices + a contract node (the star's points)
  * advice   — ranked RuleResults, phrased, each tagged with its node so the UI
               can filter to a device when its node is clicked.
