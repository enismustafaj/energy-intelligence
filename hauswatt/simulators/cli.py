"""Device simulator — replays a household's stored telemetry as live device
readings POSTed to the ingest API.

Each step is emitted as per-device ``DeviceReading``s (only for the devices the
household actually has — e.g. HH-1004 emits only PV + household), so the live
path exercises the unified-schema merge rather than just re-posting whole rows.
Deterministic and controllable: an internal cursor walks the stored series at a
configurable speed; ``--clock`` chooses whether to keep the original timestamps,
rebase them to now, or continue past the end of the data.
